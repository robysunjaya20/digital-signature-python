# Digital Signature System (Ed25519)

This project is an implementation of a **Digital Signature System** using Python, 
built as a learning project for Cryptography.

The system applies **public key cryptography** to ensure:
- Document authenticity
- Data integrity
- Non-repudiation

## 🚀 Features

- Digital signature using **Ed25519**
- Document hashing to ensure integrity
- Timestamp and signer metadata
- QR Code embedded in signed PDF
- Public verification via QR Code
- Preview PDF before signing
- Stateless document verification (no file storage)
- Unique folder per signed document
- Download signed document from verification page
- Modern web interface (FastAPI)
